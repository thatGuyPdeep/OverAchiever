Which theme are you working on?
- Gamifying Online Event Management

What are you planning to build?
- We are planning to build an interactive app which accumulates, gathers and systematically records certain aspects of students daily activities and accordingly transforms it into a gamified version, when presenting and analysing a specific student’s capacity to accomplish a task(s).

Who is the target audience?
- Educational Institute
- It can be used in other organisations(Offices, to be specific; Human Resource Management) with some modifications and adjustments. :)

How are you helping your target audience?
- To begin with, we are transforming the “old and boring grading system” that is represented as A+,B+,C+...etc into a much effective and efficient system of XP(Experience Points) that would be a source of motivation, encouragement and self sufficiency to every student out there. 



Why is your solution more suitable than what currently exists?
- The current grading system creates more indifference among students and doesn’t instil a sense of competition. Moreover, there is no accurate representation of performance with respect to knowledge gained. Most importantly there are lack of incentives for students and thus lack of motivation also. Experience points on the other hand tries to rectify almost all the problems stated above. The gesture of providing experience points of specific amounts on small but important activities during school hours might create a huge change. For example, coming class on time might give you ‘50xp’ or submitting an assignment on time would be a gain of 200xp, since the above stated examples come under a major section of “Punctuality” and being punctual is a skill thus you might achieve a certain amount of xp’s and congrats you have unlocked a new skill “Punctuality”, here’s your certificate. A release of dopamine might give the biggest lessons and teachings. And surely you would want to achieve that again or maybe something much bigger like, scoring highest in all three sections and here’s your 500xp and a bonus to every student of your class of 20xp each. Everyone is happy and satisfied moreover everyone grew together.
